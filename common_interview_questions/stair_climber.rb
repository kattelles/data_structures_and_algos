# Stair Climber: a frog climbs a set of stairs.  It can jump 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time.
# Write a function that returns all the possible ways the frog can get from the bottom step to step n.
# For example, with 3 steps, your function should return [[1, 1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [3]].
# NB: this is similar to, but not the same as, make_change.  Try implementing this using the opposite
# DP technique that you used in make_change -- bottom up if you used top down and vice versa.
