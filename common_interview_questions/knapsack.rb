# Knapsack Problem: write a function that takes in an array of weights, an array of values, and a weight capacity
  # and returns the maximum value possible given the weight constraint.  For example: if weights = [1, 2, 3],
  # values = [10, 4, 8], and capacity = 3, your function should return 10 + 4 = 14, as the best possible set of items
  # to include are items 0 and 1, whose values are 10 and 4 respectively.  Duplicates are not allowed -- that is, you
  # can only include a particular item once.
